# MCM 2022 Problem C: Trading Strategies
by Damien Ha, Darren Hsieh, Regina Thahir, Roger Wilson

## Description
This project is a solution to Problem C of the 2022 Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
A description of the problem can be found here http://www.immchallenge.org/mcm/2022_MCM_Problem_C.pdf.
It was completed in collaboration with three other UCLA students, credited above.
We submitted this project as our final assessment for the class *Mathematics 42 - Data Driven Mathematical Modeling: Life, the Universe and Everything*.

The official course description of Mathematics 42 is as follows:
  *Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Requisites: courses 31A, 31B, 32A, 32B, 33A, one statistics course from Statistics 10, 12, 13, one programming course from Computer Science 31, Program in Computing 10A, Statistics 20. Introduction to data-driven mathematical modeling combing data analysis with mechanistic modeling of phenomena from various applications. Topics include model formulation, data visualization, nondimensionalization and order-of-magnitude physics, introduction to discrete and continuous dynamical systems, and introduction to discrete and continuous stochastic models. Examples drawn from many fields and practice problems from Mathematical Contest in Modeling. P/NP or letter grading.*
